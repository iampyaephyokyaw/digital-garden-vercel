I love to write.  
  
For me, writing is like self-administered therapy—an earnest attempt to understand myself. A private conversation where I search for meaning in my own thoughts.  
  
Of course, I don’t always succeed. More often than not, I fail spectacularly because truly knowing oneself is an impossible task. Hence, "know thyself."  
  
It’s like looking in a mirror. What you see isn’t the real you—just a reflection, a mere approximation of your existence.  
  
Writing, to me, is an attempt to reflect the mind. To capture dreams, hopes, emotions, and despair—everything that passes through my consciousness.  
  
That’s why I love it. It reminds me of my flaws and keeps me humble.
