I love to write.

For me, writing is like a self-administered therapy. An earnest attempt to find myself, to understand more about myself. A private affair where a soul-searching conversation takes place between me and myself.

Obviously, I don't always succeed in doing so. More often than not, I would spectacularly fail because to truly know oneself is such an impossible task. Hence "know thyself".

It's like looking at yourself in a mirror. You know what you see in the mirror is not real you but only a reflection of you. A supposedly nearest physical approximation of your existence.

For me, writing is an attempt to see a reflection of your mind. Your dreams, hopes, emotions, despairs, whatever your mind experiences.

That's one of the major reasons I love writing. It reminds me of how flawed I am, and keeps me humble.
